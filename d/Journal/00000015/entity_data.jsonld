  "rdfs:comment": "Continuing with the PB model, I have translated the handwritten notes for blend field into an Illustrator model, which now needs checking back with the logs to make sure I have got the temporal relationships right and that I have not overlooked anything. I also need to then insert details for the other 2 blend fields.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting how I am thinking slightly different when using a pen to working in Illustrator. Both bring out somewhat different, but equally useful aspects.\r\n\r\nI am also wondering what to designate as blend nodes - so far I have only marked the obvious one - the .mov. files. It would also be useful to represent individual log entries, perhaps as different colour washes across the mode.",
