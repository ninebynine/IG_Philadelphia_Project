  "rdfs:comment": "I woke up to the good news that Ed Galloway, the head of the ULS Archives Service Center has very kindly let me use all the large-res images for free! All I need to to is downloading them from Box (cloud-based sharing system). In fact I've been given access to 25 images. At 8sec of each that makes for an overall length of 200secs. Downloading images now.\r\n\r\nNow I need to start thinking about a narrative, the sequence in which the images follow each other. I intend to start with SCIS035 showing a smog-shrouded factory and smoking chimney. I might group the rest according to subjects.\r\n\r\nI've also received a reply from the PRS requesting further information on how the work will be displayed. \r\n\r\n## A few other smoke related songs:\r\n\r\n+ Smoke on The Water -Deep Purple\r\n+ [Smoke Frome a Dristant Fire - Sanford and Townsend](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCWVuCCWqzQ) \r\n+ Fire Woman - The Cult \r\n+ Smokestack Lightning - Howlin Wolf \r\n+ [Where There's Smoke There's Fire - Johnny Taylor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5dgYayqlqYM) \r\n+ Smoke - Mary J Blige\r\n+ We didn't start the fire - Billy Joel",
