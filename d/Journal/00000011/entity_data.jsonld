  "rdfs:comment": "I've decided that, this being a collection of data pertaining to the making of the piece, I will have to upload at least some of the audio. I have edited some ReplayPlayer experiments into one file. Space being an issue I have compressed sound into a low res mp3 file at 96kbps. See below, *smoke voice 1* and *voice experiment 1*.\r\n\r\n** Interesting question: ** how much of one's mishaps and experiments the artist wants to make public??? \r\n\r\n** Note:** at the moment, the edited photographs plus basic titles come out at 4.16min. I might take the last two night images out of the sequence. Not sure they are working.\r\n\r\nContinuing to work on the sound, the day progressed in a very frustrating fashion due to faulty cables that need ferrying out. That accomplished things became more satisfying. I recorded a number of other vice tacks, this time through my sound card and some with a reverb. Each is sung in a slightly different key and speed, so when playing them together, a somewhat strange choir emerged which I feel might be a more interesting way forward. Perhaps a sonic \"fog\" analogy?\r\n\r\nMost of the individual recordings are below.\r\n\r\nTomorrow I will continue with trying to collage together a composition from the recordings done so far. It's all bit short so far and it needs some more quiet passages.",
