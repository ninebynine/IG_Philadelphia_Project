  "rdfs:comment": "This morning I\u2019ve been working the log data into Annalist; Graham had set categories up for me and talked me through the procedures. I\u2019m getting understand this a bit better. Re-reading the log entries so far makes me wonder how much information might be useful, and in what format this needs to be done for others to understand descriptions.\r\nWould a picture of my studio be useful for example?\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, I played around with the fog-frames idea. It changed a bit whilst playing around in Photoshop. Basically, I cropped and then stamped fog onto the images, saving each incarnation. This should yield a little animations sequence when imported into Premiere. The example image sequences below give a rough example of the idea.\r\n\r\nI'm also trying to crate the sequence in Premiere, but I am a bit rusty and it takes longer than anticipated.\r\n\r\nRelaxing with the remainder of last night's episode of Stargate Atlantis before editing a short and crude clip together. Not sure if this idea really works. Or, if it does in principle, whether I like it. Anyway, I've uploaded the clip to YouTube and will come back to it tomorrow.
