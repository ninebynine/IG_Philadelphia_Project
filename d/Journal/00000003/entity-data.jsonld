  "rdfs:comment": "I have been thinking about how images may be linked together. One thought is that I could isolate a region of fog to serve as a link. This would be inserted between 2 images as illustrated in sketch 1.\r\n\r\nI've also thinking about what data is important to collect. I guess these could relate in some way to envisaged inputs [as in Procedural Blending (PB)]. \r\n\r\n## So far the categories I am considering are:\r\n\r\n+  log entry \r\n+  image collection \r\n+  sound collection \r\n  * location \r\n  * events [e.g. historical events] \r\n  * web links \r\n  * tools \r\n  * authorship (image credits, bibliographical data etc)\r\n\r\nThese all equate to inputs - in some way - as I would have thought about them so far. \r\n\r\n## So, how could these categories connect to inputs:\r\n\r\n+ log entry = writing inputs into my thinking\r\n+ image collection = photographs will be a direct input to the piece, in sketches I am working out ideas\r\n+ sound collection = sound is a direct input to the piece, see log entry 1 identified various sublements of element music \r\n+ location = location features in some respetcs e.g. images of London / Detroit\r\n+ events [e.g. historical events] = fog 152 London etc\r\n+ web links = I would normally regard the information contained in each link as possible inputs\r\n+ tools = tools are also an already identified PB input\r\n+ authorship (image credits, bibliographical data etc) = yes, books and other people are an input\r\n\r\nIn a way, 3 blend lines are also coming through so far: (1) the making of the piece, (2) thinking about data, (3) correlating Annalist with PB.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Things to do:\r\n+ need to download Premiere update.\r\n+ Revisit working with still images in Premier\r\n+ Try out frame-flow sketch in Premiere",
