  "rdfs:comment": "Today I created a first full draft of the piece, which I have added to [YouTube](http://youtu.be/j3n0muR7ePA). The idea change somewhat whilst working. I tried out the collage idea, but it felt far too dense. I felt that the \"soundtrack\" needed more space and dynamical variation. I worked with a further track in ReplyPlayer and this proved a more satisfying way forward once edited (I selected the most suitable parts, changed order). I then used one of the initial recordings for the ending.\r\n\r\n## Thinking along the way: ##\r\n\r\n* restricted sonic frequency range > restricted visibility\r\n* no low frequencies > white fog\r\n\r\n## Still needs considering/working on: ##\r\n\r\n* sepia images? If I do, I will need to download Adobe After Effects\r\n* take out the last night images?\r\n* length of images\r\n* revisit transitions - some are too abrupt. Overall could still be slower.\r\n* sound intro and ending?\r\n* need to check credits\r\n* sound and image gel in some places. not in others. Once I have transitions done, need to revisit sound too\r\n\r\n ",
