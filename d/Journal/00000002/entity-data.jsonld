Too much?\r\n+ Mixing aeras/locations\r\n+ Mixing b&w with colour pix\r\n+ Format: some images are landscape, others portrait\r\n\r\nOn the whole I prefer older b&w images. They create a different flavour. So, if there not enough Philadelphia images, I could use London 1952 ones, there seem to be a great amount of images. Soundtrack: reworked version of \u201cA foggy day in London town\u201d would that be funny??\r\n\r\n[Example images from the great London fog of 1952](http://www.buzzhunt.co.uk/2013/08/29/the-london-fog-of-1952-was-so-dense-that-you-could-barely-see-through-it-26-pictures/)\r\n\r\n\r\n*later: at the desk*\r\n\r\nIf I stick with the London idea, I could use an Introductory title sequence could have info such as:\r\n\r\n[From the Met Office website:](http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/learning/learn-about-the-weather/weather-phenomena/case-studies/great-smog) \r\n\r\n>A fog so thick and polluted it left thousands dead wreaked havoc on London in 1952. The smoke-like pollution was so toxic it was even reported to have choked cows to death in the fields. It was so thick it brought road, air and rail transport to a virtual standstill. This was certainly an event to remember, but not the first smog of its kind to hit the capital.\r\nSmog had become a frequent part of London life, but nothing quite compared to the smoke-laden fog that shrouded the capital from Friday 5 December to Tuesday 9 December 1952. While it heavily affected the population of London, causing a huge death toll and inconveniencing millions of people, the people it affected were also partly to blame for the smog.\r\nDuring the day on 5 December, the fog was not especially dense and generally possessed a dry, smoky character. When nightfall came, however, the fog thickened. Visibility dropped to a few metres. The following day, the sun was too low in the sky to burn the fog away. That night and on the Sunday and Monday nights, the fog again thickened. In many parts of London, it was impossible at night for pedestrians to find their way, even in familiar districts. In The Isle of Dogs area, the fog there was so thick people could not see their feet.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Webtrawl for more images:\r\n\r\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Smog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Smog)\r\n\r\n[http://www.theguardian.com/environment/gallery/2012/dec/05/60-years-great-smog-london-in-pictures](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/gallery/2012/dec/05/60-years-great-smog-london-in-pictures)\r\n\r\n[http://www.bl.uk/catalogues/photographs](http://www.bl.uk/catalogues/photographs/)\r\n\r\n[https://www.google.co.uk/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=london+fog+1952&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&gfe_rd=cr&ei=bJfEVdaaIozu8weXoLKICQ](https://www.google.co.uk/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=london+fog+1952&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&gfe_rd=cr&ei=bJfEVdaaIozu8weXoLKICQ)\r\n\r\n[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-20615186](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-20615186)\r\n\r\n[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/earth/countryside/9727128/The-Great-Smog-of-London-the-air-was-thick-with-apathy.html](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/earth/countryside/9727128/The-Great-Smog-of-London-the-air-was-thick-with-apathy.html)\r\n\r\n[http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/capital-weather-gang/post/the-killer-london-smog-event-of-december-1952-a-reminder-of-deadly-smog-events-in-us/2012/12/19/452c66bc-498e-11e2-b6f0-e851e741d196_blog.html](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/capital-weather-gang/post/the-killer-london-smog-event-of-december-1952-a-reminder-of-deadly-smog-events-in-us/2012/12/19/452c66bc-498e-11e2-b6f0-e851e741d196_blog.html)\r\n\r\nThere are some videos on YouTube, although I would prefer photos:\r\n\r\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSlwGIapFJI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSlwGIapFJI)\r\n\r\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSlwGIapFJI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSlwGIapFJI)\r\n(This one also uses \"A foggy day\"\u2026.
