This repository contains an [Annalist](https://github.com/gklyne/annalist) data collection
of notes collected by [Iris Garrelfs](http://irisgarrelfs.com) for a possible artisitic
project about air quality issues inspired by the sights and sounds of mid 1900s Philadelphia.

The notes are to form the basis of a semi-structured data model based on [Iris' PhD thesis](http://irisgarrelfs.com/thesis) 
about *Procedural Blending*, which "aims to expand sound art discourse by considering process in sound art practice through 
an exploration of artistsâ€™ experiences".  Procedural Blending model has some marked similaroties with work on provenance
to describe processes in scientific research, but also some marked differences.

This activity is part of a JISC-funded CREAM project to explore the use of *Active Metadata*, or *Actively Used Metadata* in research and other creative processes.  This project is part of Jisc's *Research Data Spring* activity.
